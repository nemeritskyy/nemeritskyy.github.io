        <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
        <p>I’m a Junior Full-Stack Developer with a solid foundation in Java Core, Java 8, and Collections, along with
            Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and SOLID design principles. I have experience building and
            managing projects with Maven and Gradle, and I’m proficient in using Spring (Boot, MVC, Security) and
            Hibernate for enterprise application development. I have developed RESTful services, worked with WebSockets,
            and written unit tests with JUnit, practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD). I’m experienced in working with
            relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL.<br><br>

            In addition to backend development, I have frontend experience with Vue.js (Options API / Composition API,
            Vue Router, Vuex / Pinia), as well as HTML, CSS, SCSS, Pug, and JavaScript (ES6+). I have integrated
            frontend applications with APIs using Fetch and Axios and worked with UI libraries like Vuetify, Element UI,
            and Bootstrap Vue.<br><br>

            I’m proficient in Git (VCS), Docker, and have experience working in Agile teams using Jira. I possess strong
            soft skills and enjoy collaborating in a team to achieve project objectives. I am seeking a challenging
            full-stack position to continue growing and contributing to the team’s success.</p>

        <p>
            During my time in the CS106A course, I gained a solid
            foundation in computer
            science principles, focusing on programming and
            problem-solving skills using
            Java. The course emphasized the importance of writing
            efficient, well-structured
            code, and I was able to apply these concepts through a
            series of hands-on projects
            that ranged from simple algorithms to more complex
            applications. This experience
            significantly enhanced my understanding of object-oriented
            programming
            and laid the groundwork for my further studies and
            development in the field of
            software engineering.
