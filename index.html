                <h3>SUMMARY</h3>
                <p>I’m a Junior Java Developer with a solid foundation in Java
                    Core, Java 8, and Collections,
                    along with Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and
                    SOLID design principles.
                    I have experience building and managing projects with Maven
                    and Gradle, and I’m proficient
                    in using Spring and Hibernate frameworks for enterprise
                    application development.
                    I have developed RESTful services and written unit tests
                    with JUnit, practicing Test-Driven
                    Development (TDD). I’m experienced in working with
                    relational databases like MySQL
                    and PostgreSQL. I’m also familiar with web technologies
                    including Tomcat, JSP, Servlets,
                    HTML/CSS, XML, and JSON. Additionally, I’m proficient in
                    version control with Git.
                    I possess strong soft skills and enjoy working in a team to
                    achieve project objectives.
                    I am seeking a challenging position in Java development to
                    continue growing and contributing
                    to the team’s success.</p>
                <h3>WORK EXPERIENCE</h3>
                <h2>Student</h2>
                <div class="details">
                    <span>NDA, Remote, course</span>
                    <span>July 2024 - October 2024</span>
                </div>
                <p>
                    During my time in the CS106A course, I gained a solid
                    foundation in computer
                    science principles, focusing on programming and
                    problem-solving skills using
                    Java. The course emphasized the importance of writing
                    efficient, well-structured
                    code, and I was able to apply these concepts through a
                    series of hands-on projects
                    that ranged from simple algorithms to more complex
                    applications. This experience
                    significantly enhanced my understanding of object-oriented
                    programming
                    and laid the groundwork for my further studies and
                    development in the field of
                    software engineering.
                </p>

                    I have been involved in developing a QR menu application for
                    restaurants. I
                    have participated in various stages of the software
                    development cycle, including
                    planning, design, development, and testing.</p>
                <p>My responsibilities have included:</p>

                    The main themes of my work have been Java 8+, SQL, Git,
                    Spring Boot, Maven,
                    Docker, and Hibernate. This experience has allowed me to
                    develop a strong skill
                    set in these technologies and methodologies.
